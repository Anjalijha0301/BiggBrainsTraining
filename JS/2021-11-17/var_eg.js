/*
The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
Names must begin with a letter
Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names
